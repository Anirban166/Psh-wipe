Simple shell scripts I wrote to automate the process of removing unwanted residuals (files & folders) remnant after uninstallation of certain software, such as:

- [Huawei Device Drivers](/removeHuaweiStuff.sh) 
- [Microsoft Auto Update](/removeMicrosoftStuff.sh)

Always a good idea to extirpate anything redundant in `Library` (esp. subdirectories `/LaunchAgents/` and `/StartupItems/` in particular) which may potentially affect the system and/or its performance.
