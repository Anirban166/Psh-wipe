Simple shell scripts that I wrote to automate the process of removing unwanted residuals (files & folders) remnant after uninstallation of certain software in macs, such as:

- [Huawei device drivers for their dongles](/removeHuaweiStuff.sh) 
- [Microsoft applications (generating auto-update service files)](/removeMicrosoftStuff.sh)

Always a good idea to extirpate anything redundant in `Library` (especially subdirectories `/LaunchAgents/` and `/StartupItems/` in particular) which may potentially affect the system and/or its performance.
